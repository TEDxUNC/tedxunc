                            A TEDx event is a local gathering where live TED-like talks and videos previously recorded at TED conferences are shared with the community. TEDx events are fully planned and coordinated independently, on a community-by-community basis. The content and design of each TEDx event is unique and developed independently, but all of them have features in common.

                           Attendance is free and tickets are not needed.  We operate on a first come-first serve basis for seating, but we expect everyone to be able to find a seat, even if you arrive later in the day.  Doors will open 30 minutes prior to the show.

                            The theme of TEDxUNC 2017, Home, is about discovering what connects us and defines us as we all search for a sense of belonging and a place to call “home.”  This theme is applicable to all areas of life and allows us to examine topics from our tangible physical environment, to social activism within society, as well as the impact of immigration on communities, and the social forces that drive us together or pull us apart.  Although the concept of “Home” is universal, the ideas that surround this concept differ greatly between all of us.  This theme is about exploring our differences and finding a common ground upon which all of us can stand.
